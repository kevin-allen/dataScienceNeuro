# Data Science in Neuroscience

This is the repository for the course `Data Science in Neuroscience` which is offered to Masters students on the Neuroscience Major program at the  Faculty of Biosciences, University of Heidelberg.


The course is aimed at students interested in improving their ability to perform data analysis in the field of neuroscience.
