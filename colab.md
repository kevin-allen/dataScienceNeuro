# Run Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab

It is sometimes helpful to run Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. For example, if you want to train a deep neural network using a GPU but your computer does not have a GPU, you can use Google GPU to train your model.

To use Google Colab, you will need a Google account and a Google Drive. 

We will use Google Drive to access data from your Jupyter Notebook. You can also use Google drive to save results. 

## Create a folder for you data and notebooks on Google Drive

1. Create a folder in the root of your Google Drive. You can call it `dsfolder`.
2. Upload the notebook called `colab_test.ipynb` from the `notebooks` directory into the `dsfolder` of your Google Drive. 
3. Upload the file `animal_speed.npy` from the `data` folder into the `dsfolder` of your Google Drive.

## Open your Notebook in Google Colab

1. Double click on the `colab_test.ipynb` in the `dsfolder`.
2. You should now have a window with the content of the notebook.
3. Run the code of the Notebook to learn how to access your Google Drive from a notebook in Google Colab.
