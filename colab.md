# Run Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab

It is sometimes helpful to run Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab. For example, if you want to train a deep neural network using a GPU but your computer does not have a GPU, you can use Google GPU to train your model.

To use Google Colab, you will need a Google account and a Google Drive. 

We will use Google Drive to access data from your Jupyter Notebook. You can also use Google drive to save results. 

## Create a folder for you data and notebooks on Google Drive

1. Create a folder in the root of your Google Drive. You can call it `dsfolder`.
2. Upload the notebook called `colab_test.ipynb` into the `dsfolder` of your Google drive.
